# Style

Writing conventions for all KBase content.

## Tone

- Technical, objective, accurate, honest
- Concise — every word earns its place. Clear and straightforward
- State facts, not benefits or opinions
- No promotional language ("powerful", "elegant", "robust")
- No hedging ("might", "could possibly", "it seems")

## Structure

- Lead with the constraint or fact
- Tables over prose for structured data
- Code blocks for formats, templates, commands
- One concept per file; split when a file covers multiple topics
